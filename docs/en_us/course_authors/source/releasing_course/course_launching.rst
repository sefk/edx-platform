Course Launching Activities 
##############################

As the start date for your course approaches, a checklist can help you make sure that your course, and your students, are ready. Suggestions for activities to complete before your course starts follow. 


Verify Course Settings

* Verify the course start date and time in Studio. See :ref:`Set Important
  Dates for Your Course`.
* Verify the grading policy  
* Set a grace period

Welcome Students

* Compose a welcome message and add it to the Course Info page. See :ref:`Add
  a Course Update`.
* Verify that a syllabus and other references are available on the Course Handouts Page.
* Prepare and send a welcome email message to currently enrolled students one
  week or more before the course start date. See :ref:`Send_Bulk_Email`.
* Start an "Introduce Yourself" thread in a discussion. For MOOCs, start multiple threads to distribute student responses. For example, "Introduce Yourself: Europe", "Introduce Yourself: North America", etc.
* Prepare and send a launch email message to currently enrolled students on the course start date. 

Review Content for the First Week

* Verify that all units are present and published
* Check the due dates for all assignments
* Verify that videos, transcripts, and download links are in place.


Prepare Staff

* Review 
* Verify that all team  members know how to record their work, report issues, and collaborate on tasks.
* Define communication methods for the course staff and instructors, such as a course-specific email address.


*************************
Bulk Email 
*************************

With the bulk email feature, you can send email messages to course participants directly from the Instructor Dashboard. All team members who have the course staff or instructor role can use this feature to communicate with course participants before, during, and after the course run. 

When you send an email message from the Instructor Dashboard, you choose the message recipients by selecting one of these predefined groups:

* Myself, to test out a message before sending it to a larger group.
* Staff and instructors, to contact other members of the administrative team.
* All, to communicate with all currently enrolled students and the administrative team.

Before you use the bulk email feature, consider that messages cannot be cancelled after they are sent. Be sure to review each message draft carefully, and send each message to yourself for thorough review and testing, before you send it to all course participants.

--------------------------------
Message queueing and delivery
--------------------------------

When you send a message, it is queued for processing. Multiple courses use the same email queue, so it can take some time for your message to be delivered to its recipients. If your course is a MOOC, consider limiting the number of messages that you send to all course participants to no more than one per week.
